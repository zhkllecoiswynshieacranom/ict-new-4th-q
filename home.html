    <h2>Welcome!</h2>
    <p>
        Welcome to my personal blog where I share my interests, ideas, and experiences.
        This blog is a digital space that reflects my personality and creative side.
    </p>
    <p>
        Inspired by the colorful and optimistic Frutiger Aero aqua aesthetic, this site
        combines soft visuals with meaningful content about my daily life and passions.

    <h3>My Inspiration</h3>
	<p>My inspiration for my blog is Taylor Swift, I've been a fan of her since I was younger, specifically, my inspo was her debut era with the teal, light blue, and girl-next-door simple kind of vibe.</p>
